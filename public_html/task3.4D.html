            Marine Drive is a 3.6-kilometre-long Promenade along the Netaji
            Subhash Chandra Bose Road in Mumbai, India. Often, the names Marine
            Drive and Marines are used interchangeably to refer to this 3.9 km
            stretch. The road and promenade were constructed by Pallonji Mistry.
            It is a 'C'-shaped six-lane concrete road along the coast of a
            natural bay. At the northern end of Marine Drive is Girgaon
            Chowpatty and the adjacent road along links Nariman Point at
            southern tip to Babulnath and Malabar Hill at northern tip. Marine
            Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine
            Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at
            night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street
            lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace.<br />
            The official name for this road, though rarely used, is Netaji
            Subhash Chandra Bose Road. The promenade is lined with palm trees.
            At the northern end of Marine Drive is Chowpatty Beach. This is a
            popular beach famed for its Bhel Puri. Many restaurants also line
            this stretch of the road. Further down this road lies Walkeshwar, a
            wealthy neighborhood of the city, also home to the Governor of
            Maharashtra.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              Marine Drive in Mumbai emerged from the Back Bay Reclamation
              Scheme in the early 20th century, signifying the city's westward
              expansion by dredging the sea and adding land. Despite being named
              after Sir Michael Kavanagh Kennedy, who died before construction,
              it commenced in 1915 and faced challenges resulting in a shorter
              length than planned. By the mid-1930s, its infrastructure was
              largely complete, transitioning focus to Art Deco architecture.
              This stylish trend, embraced by movie stars and Parsi migrants,
              adorned Marine Drive, symbolizing both urban development and the
              cultural evolution of Mumbai. The Drive not only stands as a
              testament to architectural history but also reflects the societal
              shifts and glamour of that era.
